## Overview 
This project is an exploratory analysis of the top 1000 movies by user score on IMDb, available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows/data).
The entire analysis is available as an R-markdown file deployed on Github [here](https://taylor-parchment.github.io/IMDB-data-exploration/).

The following questions guided my analysis:
    
- What is the disparity between user and critic scores? What’s the most controversial film between users and critics?

-  How do top grossing movies score? Is there a clear correlation between score and profit?

- For each actor and director, what’s the total gross profit of all the movies they’ve participated in?

- Which genres are most prominent among the top movies?

- Which genre of movie do each actor and director prefer?

## Findings

General audience and critic favorites are almost entirely different, and some movies are especially divisive.
User-liked dramas are often subject to lower critical scores, while old, film-noir movies are extremely highly rated by critics, 
but were only received normally by the general audience.

When it comes to profit and scores, profit doesn’t tell us much about how viewers might have rated a movie, 
but higher general audience scores do seem indicative of higher gross profit. 
This is not true, however, of critic scores.

Among the actors who’ve been in the most top-grossing movies, we see a lot of actors from the Marvel franchise 
(Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo) and the Harry Potter series (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Gint).

As for genres, drama is by far the most commonly listed. Of course, movies can be listed under several genres, 
and it’s pretty hard to have a movie without some kind of drama, so it might not be very informative. Looking at actors and directors, 
some that stand out are Robert De Nero for his number of drama and crime listings, and Hayao Miyazaki for his 11 animations.
